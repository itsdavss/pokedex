## My process

This project was developed as part of the DevQuest course. We were given the necessary functionalities for the site and were free to design it in a way that best suited our preferences. On the site, we used the PokéAPI to fetch Pokémon data. I used React Router Dom to create a SPA (Single Page Application) as requested. I styled the entire site with Styled Components because I believe it was the best way to do it. The Context API was also used to create the context-based styles.

### Challenges and learnings

This was the most difficult project I've worked on so far. I am still consolidating everything I've learned about React, and I believe that by developing this project, I was able to understand better how React works.
